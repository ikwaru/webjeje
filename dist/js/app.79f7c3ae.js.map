This game combines narrative, strategic, and role-playing elements,\n                offering a unique and creative experience.\n              </p>\n              <a href=\"#\" class=\"read-more\"><span> Discover more!</span><i class=\"bi bi-arrow-right\"></i></a>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n\n      <!-- New Section -->\n      <section id=\"about\" class=\"about section light-background\">\n        <div class=\"wiki-container\" data-aos=\"fade-up\" data-aos-delay=\"100\">\n          <div class=\"row align-items-xl-center gy-5\">\n\n            <div class=\"col-xl-5 content\">\n              <h3>Be <strong>whoever</strong> you want</h3><br><br>\n              <h2>Races</h2>\n              <p>\n                Who do you want to be?

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day.\r\n                (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such\r\n                dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting\r\n                in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\r\n              <li>Languages</li>\r\n              <p>You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and\r\n                intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other\r\n                races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\r\n            </ul>\r\n\r\n          </aside>\r\n\r\n          <!-- Texto Dwarf -->\r\n          <div class=\"col-12 col-md-9\">\r\n            <div class=\"raza-dwarf\">\r\n              <div class=\"apartados\" id=\"raza-dwarf\">\r\n                <h2 class=\"races-title\">Dwarf</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and\r\n                  hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of\r\n                  goblins and orcs—these common threads unite all dwarves.\r\n                </p>\r\n\r\n                <div class=\"apartado-1\">\r\n                  <h3 id=\"short-and-stout\">Short and Stout</h3>\r\n                  <p>Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal.\r\n                    Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as\r\n                    much as a human standing nearly two feet taller.

Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is\r\n                    usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair.

For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of\r\n                    the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the\r\n                    fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a\r\n                    perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.\r\n\r\n                    Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries\r\n                    with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their\r\n                    ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t\r\n                    abandon those traditions lightly.\r\n                    <br> Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals\r\n                    of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.\r\n\r\n                    Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to\r\n                    the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget\r\n                    wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so\r\n                    what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.\r\n                  </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"apartado-3\">\r\n                  <h3 id=\"clans-and-kingdoms\">Clans and Kingdoms</h3>\r\n                  <p>Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals\r\n                    and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry,\r\n                    and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can’t find in their\r\n                    mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings\r\n                    frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are\r\n                    welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.\r\n\r\n                    The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even\r\n                    dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations,\r\n                    recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors’ names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is\r\n                    the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.\r\n\r\n                    Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some\r\n                    become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n                <div class=\"apartado-4\">\r\n                  <h3 id=\"gods-and-clan\">Gods, Gold, and Clan</h3>\r\n                  <p>Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure—for its own\r\n                    sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are\r\n                    driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory\r\n                    to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to\r\n                    restore a clan’s lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within\r\n                    the clan after having been exiled.

Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or\r\n                      gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels\r\n                      fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"apartado-5\">\r\n                    <h3 id=\"elf-names\">Elf Names</h3>\r\n                    <p>\r\n                      Elves are considered children until they declare themselves adults, some time after the hundredth\r\n                      birthday, and before this period they are called by child names.\r\n\r\n                      On declaring adulthood, an elf selects an adult name, although those who knew him or her as a\r\n                      youngster might continue to use the child name.

Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their children’s children will always be held accountable.</p>\r\n\r\n                  <div class=\"apartado-1\">\r\n                    <h3 id=\"infernal-bloodline\">Infernal Bloodline</h3>\r\n                    <p>Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look\r\n                      human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings\r\n                      have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others\r\n                      have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns.\r\n                      They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get\r\n                      upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black,\r\n                      red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range\r\n                      of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from\r\n                      behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.</p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"apartado-2\">\r\n                    <h3 id=\"self-reliant-and-suspicious\">Self-Reliant and Suspicious</h3>\r\n                    <p>Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the\r\n                      roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords.\r\n                      Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more\r\n                      respect.\r\n                      <br><br>Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and\r\n                      that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a\r\n                      friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling\r\n                      learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling\r\n                      is a firm friend or ally for life.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                  <div class=\"apartado-3\">\r\n                    <h3 id=\"tiefling-names\">Tiefling Names</h3>\r\n                    <p>Tiefling names fall into three broad categories. Tieflings born into another culture typically\r\n                      have names reflective of that culture. Some have names derived from the Infernal language, passed\r\n                      down through generations, that reflect their fiendish heritage. And some younger tieflings,\r\n                      striving to find a place in the world, adopt a name that signifies a virtue or other concept and\r\n                      then try to embody that concept. For some, the chosen name is a noble quest. For others, it’s a\r\n                      grim destiny.\r\n\r\n                      <br><br>Male Infernal Names: Akmenos, Amnon, Barakas, Damakos, Ekemon, Iados, Kairon, Leucis,\r\n                      Melech, Mordai, Morthos, Pelaios, Skamos, Therai\r\n\r\n                      <br><br>Female Infernal Names: Akta, Anakis, Bryseis, Criella, Damaia, Ea, Kallista, Lerissa,\r\n                      Makaria, Nemeia, Orianna, Phelaia, Rieta\r\n\r\n                      <br><br>“Virtue” Names: Art, Carrion, Chant, Creed, Despair, Excellence, Fear, Glory, Hope, Ideal,\r\n                      Music, Nowhere, Open, Poetry, Quest, Random, Reverence, Sorrow, Temerity, Torment, Weary\r\n                    </p>\r\n                  </div>\r\n                </div>\r\n              </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </section>\r\n\r\n      <section class=\"ayudas\">\r\n        <div class=\"narrador-selector\" aria-label=\"Narrator Selector\" id=\"narrador\">\r\n    <h2>Selective Narrator</h2>\r\n    <p>To help with reading, we have a section where the user can apply the narration once they select the text they want to listen to.

Es posible que estés usando Google Chrome, Safari o Firefox.</p>\r\n    <p>En la barra de direcciones (arriba), escribe la dirección de la página web y presiona Enter para acceder.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Ver la página de clases:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Una vez que la página cargue, verás un título grande que dice \"Classes\". Está en su idioma original, el inglés.</p>\r\n    <p>Bajo este título, habrá 12 menús desplegables (cada uno con el nombre de una clase, como \"Fighter\", \"Wizard\", \"Cleric\", etc.). Estos menús están organizados en una lista, y cada uno tiene información sobre una clase.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>¿Qué es un menú desplegable?:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Los menús desplegables son como cajas que se pueden abrir y cerrar. Cuando haces clic en uno, verás más información dentro de ese menú.</p>\r\n    <p>La información de cada clase estará escondida dentro del menú hasta que lo abras.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Cómo abrir un menú desplegable:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Para abrir el menú, haz clic en el nombre de la clase o su icono, por ejemplo, \"Barbarian\".</p>\r\n    <p>Cuando lo hagas, se abrirá un cuadro con información sobre la clase (por ejemplo, qué hace, qué habilidades tiene, etc.). Este texto te explica todo sobre esa clase.</p>\r\n    <p>También hay una imagen oficial que te ayudará a entender mejor qué es un Bárbaro.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Leer la información:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Una vez que el menú esté abierto, lee la información sobre la clase. Si la información es larga, puedes desplazar la página hacia abajo para ver más.</p>\r\n    <p>Si estás usando un ordenador, puedes usar la rueda del ratón o el deslizador en el lado derecho de la pantalla. Si estás en un teléfono, simplemente desliza el dedo hacia abajo.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Cerrar un menú:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Si quieres cerrar un menú porque ya leíste lo que necesitabas o porque quieres ver otra clase, solo tienes que hacer clic nuevamente en el nombre de la clase.</p>\r\n    <p>Esto hará que el menú se cierre y se oculte la información.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Ver todas las clases:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Si quieres ver información sobre otra clase, haz clic en el siguiente menú de la lista. Esto abrirá la información de la nueva clase, y podrás leerla igual que la anterior.</p>\r\n    <p>Recuerda que hay 12 clases en total, así que puedes abrir todos los menús para ver qué hace cada una.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Imagen de cada clase:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Mientras lees la información de cada clase, notarás que hay una imagen de cada una al lado de la descripción.</p>\r\n    <p>Estas imágenes están allí para ayudarte a visualizar mejor cómo se ve cada clase. Por ejemplo, verás a un luchador con armadura o a un mago con una varita. Las imágenes son útiles para entender más rápido de qué trata cada clase.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Ir atrás o salir de la página:</strong></p>\r\n    <p>Si ya has visto todas las clases y quieres regresar a la página anterior o salir, puedes buscar el botón de retroceder en la parte superior de la página (en la esquina izquierda). Esto te llevará de vuelta a donde estabas antes.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Consejos adicionales:</strong></p>\r\n<strong>Lee despacio:</strong> No tienes que apurarte. Lee cada clase con calma y sigue el paso a paso.\r\n<strong>Si te confundes con los menús:</strong> Recuerda que puedes abrir y cerrar los menús tantas veces como necesites. Si no entiendes algo, intenta leer otra clase para ver si te resulta más fácil.\r\n<strong>Disfruta de las imágenes:</strong> Las imágenes te ayudarán a visualizar mejor las clases y a entender más rápido. Si una clase te interesa mucho, puedes fijarte más en su imagen.\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>Ejemplo visual (Si fuera una página real):</strong></p>\r\n  \r\n        <strong>Fighter:</strong> [Información sobre qué hace un luchador] (Imagen de un luchador con espada y escudo).\r\n        <strong>Wizard:</strong> [Información sobre qué hace un mago] (Imagen de un mago con varita).\r\n        <strong>Cleric:</strong> [Información sobre qué hace un clérigo] (Imagen de un clérigo con túnica y símbolo divino).\r\n            </div>\r\n            </section>\r\n\r\n        <!-- Faq Section -->\r\n        <section id=\"faq\" class=\"faq section\">\r\n            <div class=\"container\">\r\n                <h1>Classes</h1>\r\n                <p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do.\r\n                    It's more than a profession; it's <strong>your character's calling</strong>.

Discovering the\r\n                                                magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural\r\n                                                talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack.

A bard’s\r\n                                                life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories,\r\n                                                and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other\r\n                                                entertainer.

Even wizards who train\r\n                                            apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic\r\n                                            into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require\r\n                                            mastery of different techniques.\r\n                                        </p>\r\n                                        <h4>School of Abjuration</h4>\r\n                                        <p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects.\r\n                                            Detractors of this school say\r\n\r\n                                            that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion.\r\n                                            You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak,\r\n                                            and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void.
