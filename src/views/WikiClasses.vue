                <h1>Cómo navegar la sección de clases de Dungeons & Dragons en la página web (Paso a paso)</h1>

    <p><strong>Abrir la página web:</strong></p>
    <p>Primero, abre el navegador de internet en tu computadora o teléfono. Es posible que estés usando Google Chrome, Safari o Firefox.</p>
    <p>En la barra de direcciones (arriba), escribe la dirección de la página web y presiona Enter para acceder.</p>

    <p><strong>Ver la página de clases:</strong></p>
    <p>Una vez que la página cargue, verás un título grande que dice "Classes". Está en su idioma original, el inglés.</p>
    <p>Bajo este título, habrá 12 menús desplegables (cada uno con el nombre de una clase, como "Fighter", "Wizard", "Cleric", etc.). Estos menús están organizados en una lista, y cada uno tiene información sobre una clase.</p>

    <p><strong>¿Qué es un menú desplegable?:</strong></p>
    <p>Los menús desplegables son como cajas que se pueden abrir y cerrar. Cuando haces clic en uno, verás más información dentro de ese menú.</p>
    <p>La información de cada clase estará escondida dentro del menú hasta que lo abras.</p>

    <p><strong>Cómo abrir un menú desplegable:</strong></p>
    <p>Para abrir el menú, haz clic en el nombre de la clase o su icono, por ejemplo, "Barbarian".</p>
    <p>Cuando lo hagas, se abrirá un cuadro con información sobre la clase (por ejemplo, qué hace, qué habilidades tiene, etc.). Este texto te explica todo sobre esa clase.</p>
    <p>También hay una imagen oficial que te ayudará a entender mejor qué es un Bárbaro.</p>

    <p><strong>Leer la información:</strong></p>
    <p>Una vez que el menú esté abierto, lee la información sobre la clase. Si la información es larga, puedes desplazar la página hacia abajo para ver más.</p>
    <p>Si estás usando un ordenador, puedes usar la rueda del ratón o el deslizador en el lado derecho de la pantalla. Si estás en un teléfono, simplemente desliza el dedo hacia abajo.</p>

    <p><strong>Cerrar un menú:</strong></p>
    <p>Si quieres cerrar un menú porque ya leíste lo que necesitabas o porque quieres ver otra clase, solo tienes que hacer clic nuevamente en el nombre de la clase.</p>
    <p>Esto hará que el menú se cierre y se oculte la información.</p>

    <p><strong>Ver todas las clases:</strong></p>
    <p>Si quieres ver información sobre otra clase, haz clic en el siguiente menú de la lista. Esto abrirá la información de la nueva clase, y podrás leerla igual que la anterior.</p>
    <p>Recuerda que hay 12 clases en total, así que puedes abrir todos los menús para ver qué hace cada una.</p>

    <p><strong>Imagen de cada clase:</strong></p>
    <p>Mientras lees la información de cada clase, notarás que hay una imagen de cada una al lado de la descripción.</p>
    <p>Estas imágenes están allí para ayudarte a visualizar mejor cómo se ve cada clase. Por ejemplo, verás a un luchador con armadura o a un mago con una varita. Las imágenes son útiles para entender más rápido de qué trata cada clase.</p>

    <p><strong>Ir atrás o salir de la página:</strong></p>
    <p>Si ya has visto todas las clases y quieres regresar a la página anterior o salir, puedes buscar el botón de retroceder en la parte superior de la página (en la esquina izquierda). Esto te llevará de vuelta a donde estabas antes.</p>

    <p><strong>Consejos adicionales:</strong></p>
<strong>Lee despacio:</strong> No tienes que apurarte. Lee cada clase con calma y sigue el paso a paso.
<strong>Si te confundes con los menús:</strong> Recuerda que puedes abrir y cerrar los menús tantas veces como necesites. Si no entiendes algo, intenta leer otra clase para ver si te resulta más fácil.
<strong>Disfruta de las imágenes:</strong> Las imágenes te ayudarán a visualizar mejor las clases y a entender más rápido. Si una clase te interesa mucho, puedes fijarte más en su imagen.

                <h1>Classes</h1>
                <p>Class is the primary definition of what your character can do.
                    It's more than a profession; it's <strong>your character's calling</strong>. Class shapes the way
                    you think about the
                    world and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse.
                    <br><br>
                    A fighter, for example, might view the world in pragmatic terms of strategy and maneuvering, and see
                    herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing
                    servant in a god's unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has
                    contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and
                    devotees who share his faith.
                    <br><br>
                    Your class gives you a variety of <strong>special features</strong>, such as a fighter's mastery of
                    weapons and
                    armor, and a wizard's spells. At low levels, your class gives you only two or three features, but as
                    you advance in level you gain more and your existing features often improve.
                    <br><br>

                                                unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion,

                                                People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set

                                                from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority.
                                                To a
                                                barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness.

                                                barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without
                                                resting,
                                                but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats
                                                arise.

                                            <h4>A Life of Danger</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of
                                                civilized
                                                society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is
                                                as
                                                uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar
                                                role
                                                as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the
                                                wild
                                                places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather,
                                                and
                                                terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that
                                                their people don’t have to.

                                                Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited
                                                for
                                                adventuring, Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes,
                                                and
                                                the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian.
                                                Some
                                                barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but
                                                eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of
                                                their
                                                adventuring parties.

                                        <p>In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a

                                            as a bonus action.
                                            While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing

                                            armor:

                                                as
                                                shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.

                                            <li>You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

                                            while raging.

                                            Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked
                                            unconscious
                                            or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile creature since
                                            your
                                            last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your
                                            turn as a bonus action.

                                            Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level
                                            in
                                            the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest
                                            before
                                            you can rage again.

                                        <h4>Unarmored Defense</h4>
                                        <p>While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your
                                            Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a shield and
                                            still gain this benefit.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Reckless Attack</h4>
                                        <p> 2nd level: You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce
                                            desperation. When you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide to
                                            attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon attack rolls
                                            using Strength during this turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage
                                            until your next turn.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Danger Sense</h4>
                                        <p>2nd level: You gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they
                                            should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.

                                            You have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can
                                            see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded,
                                            deafened, or incapacitated.</p>
                                        <h4>Primal Path</h4>
                                        <p>3rd level: You choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage. Choose the
                                            Path of the Berserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the
                                            end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level
                                            and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

                                        <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
                                        <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
                                            can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
                                            ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                            score above 20 using this feature.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Extra Attack</h4>
                                        <p>5th level: You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
                                            Attack action on your turn.</p>
                                        <h4>Fast Movemement</h4>
                                        <p>5th level: Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy
                                            armor.</p>
                                        <h4>Feral Instinct</h4>
                                        <p>7th level: Your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative
                                            rolls.

                                            Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't
                                            incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you
                                            enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Brutal Critical</h4>
                                        <p>9th level: You can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the
                                            extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

                                            This increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three additional
                                            dice at 17th level.</p>
                                        <h4>Relentless Rage</h4>
                                        <p>11th level: Your rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you
                                            drop to 0 hit points while you're raging and don’t die outright, you can
                                            make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, you drop to 1 hit
                                            point instead.

                                            Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When
                                            you finish a short or long rest, the DC resets to 10.</p>
                                        <h4>Persistent Rage</h4>
                                        <p>15th level: Your rage is so fierce that it ends early only if you fall
                                            unconscious or if you choose to end it.</p>
                                        <h4>Indomitable Might</h4>
                                        <p>18th level: If your total for a Strength check is less than your Strength
                                            score, you can use that score in place of the total.</p>
                                        <h4>Primal Champion</h4>
                                        <p>20th level: You embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and Constitution
                                            scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is now 24.</p>

                                        <p>Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace that drives him or her
                                            toward greatness. Different
                                            barbarians attribute their rage to different sources, however. For some, it
                                            is an internal reservoir where pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury
                                            hard as steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of a totem
                                            animal.</p>
                                        <h4>Path of the Berserker</h4>
                                        <p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being violence. The
                                            Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As
                                            you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless
                                            of your own health or well-being.</p>

                                            can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
                                            the duration of your rage you can make a single melee weapon attack as a
                                            bonus action on each of your turns after this one.</p>
                                        <h5>Mindless Rage</h5>
                                        <p>Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If
                                            you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
                                            suspended for the duration of the rage.</p>
                                        <h5>intimidating Presence</h5>
                                        <p>Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with
                                            your menacing presence.

                                            When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you.
                                            If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving
                                            throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or
                                            be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns,
                                            you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the
                                            frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the
                                            creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from
                                            you.

                                            If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can't use this feature on
                                            that creature again for 24 hours.</p>
                                        <h5>Retaliation</h5>
                                        <p>Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
                                            a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use your reaction to make a
                                            melee weapon attack against that creature.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Path of the Totem Warrior</h4>
                                        <p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian
                                            accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector. and inspiration. In battle,
                                            your totem spirit fills you

                                            with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.

                                            Most barbarian tribes consider a totem animal to be kin to a particular
                                            clan. In such cases, it is unusual for an individual to have more than one
                                            totem animal spirit, though exceptions exist.</p>

                                        <p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a
                                            kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the
                                            ability to cast the beast sense and speak with animals spells. but only as
                                            rituals.</p>
                                        <h5>Totem Spirit</h5>
                                        <p>Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a

                                        <h5>Spirit Seeker</h5>
                                        <p>At 3rd level, when you adopt this path, you choose a totem spirit and gain
                                            its feature. You must make or acquire a physical totem object- an amulet or
                                            similar adornment—that incorporates fur or feathers, claws. teeth, or bones
                                            of the totem animal. At your option, you also gain minor physical attributes
                                            that are reminiscent of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
                                            totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thickskinned, or if your
                                            totem is the eagle, your eyes turn bright yellow.
                                            Your totem animal might be an animal related to those listed here but more
                                            appropriate to your homeland. For example. you could choose a hawk or
                                            vulture in place of an eagle.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Bear </strong>. While raging. you have resistance to all damage
                                                except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you tough enough to
                                                stand up to any punishment.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Eagle </strong>. While you're raging and aren't wearing heavy
                                                armor,
                                                other creatures have disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against
                                                you,
                                                and you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The
                                                spirit
                                                of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave through the fray
                                                with
                                                ease.</li>

                                            <li><strong>Wolf </strong>. While you're raging, your friends have advantage
                                                on
                                                melee attack rolls against any creature within 5 feet of you that is
                                                hostile
                                                to you. The spirit of the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.</li>

                                        </p>

                                            choice. You can choose the same animal you selected at 3rd level or a
                                            different one.
                                            <strong>Bear </strong>. You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying capacity
                                            (including maximum load and maximum lift) is doubled, and you have advantage
                                            on Strength checks made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.

                                            <strong>Eagle </strong>. You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can see up
                                            to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern even fine details as
                                            though looking at something no more than 100 feet away from you.
                                            Additionally, dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom
                                            (Perception) checks.

                                            <strong>Wolf </strong>. You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You
                                            can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace, and you can move
                                            stealthily while traveling at a normal pace (see chapter 8 for rules on
                                            travel pace).
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Spirit Walker</h5>
                                        <p>At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature spell, but only as a
                                            ritual. When you do so, a spiritual version of one of the animals you chose
                                            for Totem Spirit or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the
                                            information you seek.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Totemic Attunement</h5>
                                        <p>At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a totem animal of your
                                            choice. You can choose the same animal you selected previously or a
                                            different one.
                                            <strong>Bear </strong>. While you're raging, any creature within 5 feet of
                                            you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets
                                            other than you or another character with this feature. An enemy is immune to
                                            this effect if it can't see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
                                            <strong>Eagle </strong>. While raging, you have a flying speed equal to your
                                            current walking speed. This benefit works only in short bursts; you fall if
                                            you end your turn in the air and nothing else is holding you aloft.
                                            <strong>Wolf </strong>. While you're raging, you can use a bonus action on
                                            your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone when you hit it with
                                            melee weapon attack.

                                            <h4>Music and Magic</h4>
                                            <p>In the worlds of D&D, words and music are not just vibrations of air, but
                                                vocalizations with power all their own. The bard is a master of song,
                                                speech, and the magic they contain. Bards say that the multiverse was
                                                spoken into existence, that the words of the gods gave it shape, and
                                                that echoes of these primordial Words of Creation still resound
                                                throughout the cosmos. The music of bards is an attempt to snatch and
                                                harness those echoes, subtly woven into their spells and powers.</p>

                                            <p>The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility. Many bards
                                                prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire
                                                their allies and hinder their foes from a distance. But bards are
                                                capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary. using their magic
                                                to bolster their swords and armor. Their spells lean toward charms and
                                                illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells. They have a
                                                wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets
                                                them do almost anything well. Bards become masters of the talents they
                                                set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric
                                                knowledge.</p>
                                            <h4>Learning from Experience</h4>
                                            <p>True bards are not common in the world. Not every minstrel singing in a
                                                tavern or jester cavorting in a royal court is a bard. Discovering the
                                                magic hidden in music requires hard study and some measure of natural
                                                talent that most troubadours and jongleurs lack. It can be hard to spot
                                                the difference between these performers and true bards, though. A bard’s
                                                life is spent wandering across the land gathering lore, telling stories,
                                                and living on the gratitude of audiences, much like any other
                                                entertainer. But a depth of knowledge, a level of musical skill, and a
                                                touch of magic set bards apart from their fellows.</p>
                                            <p>Only rarely do bards settle in one place for long, and their natural
                                                desire to travel—to find new tales to tell, new skills to learn, and new
                                                discoveries beyond the horizon—makes an adventuring career a natural
                                                calling. Every adventure is an opportunity to learn, practice a variety
                                                of skills, enter long-forgotten tombs, discover lost works of magic,
                                                decipher old tomes, travel to strange places, or encounter exotic
                                                creatures. Bards love to accompany heroes to witness their deeds
                                                firsthand. A bard who can tell an awe-inspiring story from personal
                                                experience earns renown among other bards. Indeed, after telling so many
                                                stories about heroes accomplishing mighty deeds, many bards take these
                                                themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.</p>

                                            with your wishes and music. Your spells are part of your vast
                                            repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.</p>
                                        <h4>Bardic Inspiration</h4>
                                        <p>You can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use
                                            a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself
                                            within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
                                            Inspiration die, a d6.

                                            Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add
                                            the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it
                                            makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before
                                            deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the
                                            DM says whether the roli succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration
                                            die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic
                                            Inspiration die at a time.</p>
                                        <p>You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma
                                            modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you
                                            finish a long rest. Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
                                            certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10
                                            at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.</p>

                                        <p>2nd level: You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any

                                            hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each
                                            of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

                                            The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class:
                                            to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.</p>

                                            end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level

                                        <p>3rd level: Choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is
                                            doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen
                                            proficiencies.

                                            10th level: You can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this
                                            benefit.</p>

                                            1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this

                                        <h3>Bard Colleges</h3>
                                        <p>The way of a bard is gregarious. Bards seek each other out to swap songs and
                                            stories, boast of their accomplishments, and share their knowledge. Bards
                                            form loose associations, which they call colleges, to facilitate their
                                            gatherings and preserve their traditions</p>
                                        <h4>College of Lore</h4>
                                        <p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting
                                            bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant
                                            tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in
                                            royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When
                                            the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves
                                            questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the
                                            priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.

                                            The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in
                                            fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps
                                            such a bard asa herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest
                                            than politic.

                                            The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges,
                                            complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one
                                            another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can
                                            expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at selfimportant figures of
                                            authority.</p>

                                            you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or

                                            a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the

                                            creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.

                                                <br><br>Clerics are intermediaries between the mortal world and the
                                                distant planes of the gods. As varied as the gods they serve, clerics
                                                strive to embody the handiwork of their deities. No ordinary priest, a
                                                cleric is imbued with divine magic.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>Healers and Warriors</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Divine magic, as the name suggests, is the power of the gods, flowing
                                                from them into the world. Clerics are conduits for that power,
                                                manifesting it as miraculous effects. The gods don’t grant this power to
                                                everyone who seeks it, but only to those chosen to fulfill a high
                                                calling. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on study or training. A
                                                cleric might learn formulaic prayers and ancient rites, but the ability
                                                to cast cleric spells relies on devotion and an intuitive sense of a
                                                deity’s wishes.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies
                                                with spells that harm and hinder foes. They can provoke awe and dread,
                                                lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to
                                                consume their enemies. For those evildoers who will benefit most from a
                                                mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them
                                                wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.

                                            <h4>Divine Agents</h4>
                                            <p>
                                                Not every acolyte or officiant at a temple or shrine is a cleric. Some
                                                priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out
                                                their gods’ will through prayer and sacrifice, not by magic and strength
                                                of arms. In some cities, priesthood amounts to a political office,
                                                viewed as a stepping stone to higher positions of authority and
                                                involving no communion with a god at all. True clerics are rare in most
                                                hierarchies.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                When a cleric takes up an adventuring life, it is usually because his or
                                                her god demands it. Pursuing the goals of the gods often involves
                                                braving dangers beyond the walls of civilization, smiting evil or
                                                seeking holy relics in ancient tombs. Many clerics are also expected to
                                                protect their deities’ worshipers, which can mean fighting rampaging
                                                orcs, negotiating peace between warring nations, or sealing a portal
                                                that would allow a demon prince to enter the world.

                                                Most adventuring clerics maintain some connection to established temples
                                                and orders of their faiths. A temple might ask for a cleric’s aid, or a
                                                high priest might be ina position to demand it. </p>

                                        <p>As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Divine Domain</h4>
                                        <p>Choose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature,
                                            Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the
                                            class description, and each one provides examples of gods associated
                                            with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other features when
                                            you choose it at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use
                                            Channel Divinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional
                                            benefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.

                                        <h4>Channel Divinity</h4>
                                        <p>At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly from
                                            your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You start with
                                            two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by your domain.
                                            Some domains grant you additional effects as you advance in levels, as
                                            noted in the domain description.

                                            When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to create.
                                            You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel Divinity
                                            again.

                                            Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use such
                                            an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save DC.

                                            Beginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice between
                                            rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three times between
                                            rests. When you finish a short or long rest, you regain your expended
                                            uses.</p>
                                        <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
                                        <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level,
                                            you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can
                                            increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t
                                            increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

                                        <h4>Destroy Undead</h4>
                                        <p>Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against your
                                            Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its
                                            challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the
                                            Destroy Undead table.</p>
                                        <h4>Divine Intervention</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on your
                                            behalf when your need is great.

                                            Imploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe the
                                            assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a number
                                            equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
                                            chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any cleric spell
                                            or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.

                                            If your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7 days.
                                            Otherwise, you can use it again after you finish a long rest.

                                            At 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds automatically, no
                                            roll required.

                                        <p>In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different aspects of mortal
                                            life and civilization, called a deity’s domain. All the domains over which a
                                            deity has influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example, the
                                            portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the domains of Knowledge, Life,
                                            and Light. As a cleric, you choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to
                                            emphasize, and you are granted powers related to that domain.</p>

                                            Your choice might correspond to a particular sect dedicated to your deity.
                                            Apollo, for example, could be worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”)
                                            Apollo, emphasizing his influence over the Light domain, and in a different
                                            place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”), emphasizing his association with the
                                            Life domain. Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a matter
                                            of personal preference, the aspect of the deity that appeals to you most.

                                            Each domain’s description gives examples of deities who have influence over
                                            that domain. Gods are included from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms,
                                            Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as from the
                                            Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons of antiquity.

                                        <h4>Knowledge Domain</h4>
                                        <p>The gods of knowledge—including Oghma, Boccob, Gilean, Aureon, and
                                            Thoth—value learning and understanding above all. Some teach that knowledge
                                            is to be gathered and shared in libraries and universities, or promote the
                                            practical knowledge of craft and invention. Some deities hoard knowledge and
                                            keep its secrets to themselves. And some promise their followers that they
                                            will gain tremendous power if they unlock the secrets of the multiverse.
                                            Followers of these gods study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into
                                            the secret places of the earth, and learn all they can. Some gods of
                                            knowledge promote the practical knowledge of craft and invention, including
                                            smith deities like Gond, Reorx, Onatar, Moradin, Hephaestus, and Goibhniu.

                                            shadowy glimpses of recent events.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Object Reading </strong>. Holding an object as you meditate, you
                                                can see visions of the object’s previous owner. After meditating for 1
                                                minute, you learn how the owner acquired and lost the object, as well as
                                                the most recent significant event involving the object and that owner.

                                                If the object was owned by another creature in the recent past (within a
                                                number of days equal to your Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional

                                            <li><strong>Area Reading </strong>. As you meditate, you see visions of
                                                recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room, street, tunnel,

                                                days equal to your Wisdom score. For each minute you meditate, you learn
                                                about one significant event, beginning with the most recent. Significant
                                                events typically involve powerful emotions, such as battles and
                                                betrayals, marriages and murders, births and funerals. However, they
                                                might also include more mundane events that are nevertheless important

                                            The Life domain focuses on the vibrant positive energy—one of the
                                            fundamental forces of the universe— that sustains all life. The gods of life

                                            Ilmater, Mishakal, Apollo, and Diancecht), and gods of home and community

                                        <p>Starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more effective. Whenever you
                                            use a spell of 1st level or higher to restore hit points to a creature, the

                                            maximum. You can’t use this feature on an undead or a construct.

                                            well. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hit points
                                            to a creature other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2 + the spell’s

                                            attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the
                                            target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

                                        <h5>Supreme Healing</h5>
                                        <p>Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to
                                            restore hit points with a spell,you instead use the highest number possible
                                            for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points toa creature,
                                            you restore 12.

                                            renewal, truth, vigilance, and beauty, often using the symbol of the sun.
                                            Some of these gods are portrayed as the sun itself or as a charioteer who
                                            guides the sun across the sky. Others are tireless sentinels whose eyes
                                            pierce every shadow and see through every deception. Some are deities of
                                            beauty and artistry, who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's
                                            improvement. Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with
                                            radiance and the power of their gods’ discerning vision, charged with
                                            chasing away lies and burning away darkness. </p>

                                            attacking enemy. When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you
                                            that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the
                                            attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker before it hits or
                                            misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded is immune to this feature.

                                            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a
                                            minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                                            2nd level: You can use your Channel Divinity to harness
                                            sunlight, banishing darkness and dealing radiant damage to your foes.

                                            As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any magical darkness within
                                            30 feet of you is dispelled. Additionally, each hostile creature within 30
                                            feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes radiant
                                            damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level on a failed saving throw, and half
                                            as much damage on a successful one. A creature that has total cover from you
                                            is not affected.</p>
                                        <h5>Improved Flare</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You can also use your Warding Flare feature when a
                                            creature that you can see within 30 feet of you attacks a creature other
                                            than you.</p>
                                        <h5>Potent Spellcasting</h5>
                                        <p>8th level: You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal
                                            with any cleric cantrip</p>
                                        <h5>Corona of Light</h5>
                                        <p>17th level: You can use your action to activate an aura of
                                            sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it using another
                                            action. You emit bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light 30 feet
                                            beyond that. Your enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving
                                            throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.</p>

                                        <h4>Nature Domain</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world

                                            itself, from inscrutable gods of the deep forests (such as Silvanus,
                                            Obad-Hai, Chislev, Balinor, and Pan) to friendly deities associated with
                                            particular springs and groves (such as Eldath). Druids revere nature as a
                                            whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and
                                            reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of
                                            these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in
                                            advancing the interests of a particular nature god. These clerics might hunt
                                            the evil monstrosities that despoil the woodlands, bless the harvest of the
                                            faithful, or wither the crops of those who anger their gods. </p>
                                        <h5>Acolyte of Nature</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also gain
                                            proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Animal Handling,
                                            Nature, or Survival.</p>
                                        <h5>Bonus Proficiency</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            1st level: You gain proficiency with heavy armor.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Channel Divinity: Charm Animals and Plants</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            2nd level: You can use your Channel Divinity to charm animals and plants.

                                            As an action, you present your holy symbol and invoke the name of your
                                            deity. Each beast or plant creature that can see you within 30 feet of you
                                            must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it
                                            is charmed by you for 1 minute or until it takes damage. While it is charmed
                                            by you, it is friendly to you and other creatures you designate.</p>
                                        <h5>Dampen Elements</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: When you or a creature within 30 feet of you takes acid, cold,
                                            fire, lightning, or thunder damage, you can use your reaction to grant
                                            resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.</p>
                                        <h5>Divine Strike</h5>
                                        <p>8th level: You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine
                                            energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon
                                            attack, you

                                            can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 cold, fire, or lightning damage
                                            (your choice) to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
                                            increases to 2d8.</p>
                                        <h5>Master of Nature</h5>
                                        <p>17th level: You gain the ability to command animals and plant creatures.
                                            While creatures are charmed by your Charm Animals and Plants feature, you
                                            can take a bonus action on your turn to verbally command what each of those
                                            creatures will do on its next turn..

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Tempest Domain</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Gods whose portfolios include the Tempest domain— including Talos, Umberlee,
                                            Kord, Zeboim, the Devourer, Zeus, and Thor—govern storms, sea, and sky. They
                                            include gods of lightning and thunder, gods of earthquakes, some fire gods,
                                            and certain gods of violence, physical strength, and courage. In some
                                            pantheons, a god of this domain rules over other deities and is known for
                                            swift justice delivered by thunderbolts. In the pantheons of seafaring
                                            people, gods of this domain are ocean deities and the patrons of sailors.
                                            Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either
                                            to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to
                                            offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>
                                        <h5>Wrath of the Storm</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: You can thunderously rebuke attackers. When a creature within 5
                                            feet of you that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your
                                            reaction to cause the creature to make a Dexterity saving throw. The
                                            creature takes 2d8 lightning or thunder damage (your choice) on a failed
                                            saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one.

                                            You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a
                                            minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

                                            2nd level: You can use your Channel Divinity to wield the power of the storm
                                            with unchecked ferocity.

                                            When you roll lightning or thunder damage, you can use your Channel Divinity
                                            to deal maximum damage, instead of rolling. </p>
                                        <h5>Thunderbolt Strike</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: when you deal lightning damage to a Large or smaller creature, you
                                            can also push it up to 10 feet away from you.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Divine Strike</h5>
                                        <p>8th level: You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine
                                            energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon
                                            attack, you

                                            can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 thunder damage to the target. When
                                            you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.</p>

                                        <p>17th level: You have a flying speed equal to your current walking speed
                                            whenever you are not underground or indoors

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Trickery Domain</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Gods of trickery—such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl
                                            Glittergold, and Loki—are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a
                                            constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals.
                                            They’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators.
                                            Their clerics are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking
                                            tyrants, stealing from the rich, freeing captives, and flouting hollow
                                            traditions. They prefer subterfuge, pranks, deception, and theft rather than
                                            direct confrontation.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>1st level:
                                            Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can use your action
                                            to touch a willing creature other than yourself to give it advantage on
                                            Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts for 1 hour or until you use
                                            this feature again.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Channel Divinity: Invoke Duplicity</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            2nd level: You can use your Channel Divinity to create an illusory duplicate
                                            of yourself.

                                            As an action, you create a perfect illusion of yourself that lasts for 1
                                            minute, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating
                                            on a spell). The illusion appears in an unoccupied space that you can see
                                            within 30 feet of you. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
                                            illusion up to 30 feet to a space you can see, but it must remain within 120
                                            feet of you.

                                            For the duration, you can cast spells as though you were in the illusion’s
                                            space, but you must use your own senses. Additionally, when both you and
                                            your illusion are within 5 feet of a creature that can see the illusion, you

                                            War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can
                                            be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing
                                            instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch
                                            over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such
                                            gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering
                                            acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and
                                            chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and KiriJolith) as well as gods of
                                            destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and
                                            gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet).
                                            Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance,
                                            promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any
                                            circumstance.

                                                powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity.
                                                Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with
                                                nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods
                                                of wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic
                                                traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the
                                                worship of gods in temples and shrines.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals— the power of tooth
                                                and claw, of sun and moon, of fire and storm. Druids also gain the
                                                ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study
                                                of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to
                                                their natural form.</p>
                                            <h4>Preserve the Balance</h4>
                                            <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that
                                                make up a world—air, earth, fire,
                                                and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power
                                                over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the
                                                elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus,
                                                druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element
                                                to the exclusion of others.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that
                                                sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live
                                                in harmony with nature, not in opposition to it. Druids accept that
                                                which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural,
                                                including aberrations (such as beholders and mind flayers) and undead
                                                (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such
                                                creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids’
                                                territory.

                                                Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of
                                                unspoiled nature. But when a significant danger arises, threatening
                                                nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active
                                                role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>

                                            beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You
                                            regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

                                            Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown
                                            in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform
                                            into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn’t

                                                Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and

                                                creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
                                                bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s
                                                bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair
                                                actions, you can’t use them.

                                            <li>When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice.
                                                When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit
                                                points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a
                                                result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over

                                        <h3>Druid Circles</h3>
                                        <p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of
                                            a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. Ali druids are
                                            nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so
                                            isolated that they have never seen any high-ranking members of the society
                                            or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as
                                            brothers and sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids
                                            sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.

                                            At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain
                                            perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>
                                        <h4>Circle of the Land</h4>
                                        <p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient
                                            knowledge and rites through

                                            a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or
                                            standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest
                                            members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old
                                            Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this
                                            circle, your magic is influenced

                                            by the land where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.</p>

                                            expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level
                                            that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none
                                            of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can't use this feature again
                                            until you finish a long rest

                                            For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two
                                            levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level slot or two
                                            1st-level slots.

                                            certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle
                                            spells connected

                                            to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast,
                                            desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or Underdark—and consult the
                                            associated

                                            list of spells.

                                            Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it
                                            doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you
                                            gain access toa spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell
                                            is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>
                                        <h5>Land's Stride</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra
                                            movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed
                                            by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or
                                            a similar hazard.

                                            In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are
                                            magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by
                                            the entangle spell.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Nature's Ward</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: Creatures of the natural world sense your connection to nature
                                            and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast or plant creature attacks
                                            you, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your druid spell
                                            save DC. On a failed save, the creature must choose a different target, or
                                            the attack automatically misses. On a successful save, the creature is
                                            immune to this effect for 24 hours.

                                            The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.

                                        <h5>Nature's Sanctuary</h5>
                                        <p>10th level: You can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you
                                            are immune to poison and disease.

                                        <h4>Circle of the Moon</h4>
                                        <p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their
                                            order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They
                                            haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on
                                            end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another
                                            druid.

                                            Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat
                                            one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash
                                            through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster. The
                                            wild is in the druid’s blood.</p>
                                        <h5>Combat Wild Shape</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: You gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus
                                            action, rather than as an action.

                                            Additionally, while you are transformed by Wild Shape, you can use a bonus
                                            action to expend one spell slot to regain 1d8 hit points per level of the
                                            spell slot expended.</p>
                                        <h5>Circle Forms</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: You can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a
                                            challenge rating as high as 1 (you ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast
                                            Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there).

                                            6th level: You can transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as
                                            your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

                                        <p>10th level: You can expend two uses of Wild Shape at the same time to
                                            transform into an air elemental, an earth elemental, a fire elemental, or a
                                            water elemental.

                                            <h4>Well-Rounded Specialists</h4>
                                            <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing
                                                an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a
                                                bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a
                                                fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic
                                                degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of
                                                combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons
                                                at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This
                                                combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes
                                                fighters superior combatants

                                                on battlefields and in dungeons alike.

                                            <h4>Trained for Danger</h4>
                                            <p>Not every member of the city watch, the village militia, or the queen’s
                                                army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained
                                                soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers,
                                                military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar
                                                figures are fighters.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The
                                                dungeon delving. monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among
                                                adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from
                                                the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks, perhaps, but
                                                also much greater rewards—few fighters in the city watch have the
                                                opportunity to discover a magic flame tongue sword, for example.</p>

                                        <p>3rd level: You choose an archetype that you strive to emulate in your combat

                                            Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques
                                            passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic

                                                attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.

                                                all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long
                                                rest.

                                            <li><strong>Saving Throws </strong>. Some of your maneuvers require your

                                        <p>
                                            The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all
                                            fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical
                                            techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on
                                            two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration
                                            spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and
                                            evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter’s
                                            reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells,
                                            committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.

                                            See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the

                                                the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your
                                                choice at 10th level.

                                            <li><strong>Spell Slots</strong>. The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table
                                                shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and
                                                higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the
                                                spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you
                                                finish a long rest.

                                            <li><strong>Spells Known of 1st Level or Higher</strong>. You know three
                                                1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose
                                                from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.
                                                The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows
                                                when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these
                                                spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and must
                                                be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
                                                reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd

                                                The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any
                                                school of magic.

                                                Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the
                                                wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard
                                                spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell
                                                slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're
                                                replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th. or 20th level.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Spellcasting Ability</strong>. Intelligence is your spellcasting
                                                ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through
                                                study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell
                                                refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your

                                                spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

                                        <h5>Weapon Bond</h5>
                                        <p>3rd level: You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself
                                            and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can
                                            be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout
                                            the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the
                                            bond.

                                            Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that
                                            weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of
                                            existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn,
                                            causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.

                                            You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time
                                            with your bonus action.

                                            If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one
                                            of the other two.

                                            resistance to your spells. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack,
                                            that creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw

                                            it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.

                                            space you can see when you use your Action Surge. You can teleport before or

                                                    half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed
                                                    ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them,

                                                    Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a
                                                    battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and

                                                magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether

                                            <h4>The Magic of Ki</h4>
                                            <p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic
                                                traditions call ki. This energy is an element

                                                of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that
                                                flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves
                                                to create magical effects and exceed their bodies’ physical
                                                capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of
                                                ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed
                                                and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their
                                                martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over
                                                their bodies and the bodies of their foes.

                                            </p>
                                            <h4>Training and Asceticism</h4>
                                            <p>Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny
                                                refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still.
                                                The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation
                                                and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to
                                                live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to
                                                support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had
                                                performed for their families.

                                                Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded
                                                from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are
                                                sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the
                                                command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine
                                                power.
                                                The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits
                                                to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and
                                                other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their
                                                neighbors from monsters or tyrants.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal
                                                lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and
                                                monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take
                                                their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of
                                                their physical and spiritual growth.

                                                As arule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a
                                                desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and
                                                plundering their treasure</p>
                                            <h4>Preserve the Balance</h4>
                                            <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that
                                                make up a world—air, earth, fire,
                                                and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power
                                                over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the
                                                elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus,
                                                druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element
                                                to the exclusion of others.

                                            you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do so, the damage you take

                                            you hit another creature with a melee weapon attack, you can spend 1 ki
                                            point to attempt a stunning strike. The target must succeed on a

                                            breath or a fireball spell. When you are subjected to an effect that allows
                                            you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead
                                            take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if

                                            all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature that can understand a language
                                            can understand what you say.
                                        </p>

                                            old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still die of old age,
                                            however. In addition, you no longer need food or water.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Empty Body</h4>

                                        <h3>Monastic Traditions</h3>
                                        <p>Three traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries scattered
                                            across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively,
                                            but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his
                                            or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic
                                            techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need
                                            choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.

                                        <h4>Way of the Open Hand</h4>
                                        <p>Monks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of martial arts
                                            combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques to push and trip
                                            their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to their bodies, and practice
                                            advanced meditation that can protect them from harm.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Open Hand Technique</h5>

                                            you can manipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you
                                            hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you
                                            can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
                                            </li>

                                            <li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to
                                                15 feet away from you.
                                            </li>

                                            regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You must finish a
                                            long rest before you can use this feature again.

                                        <p>11th level: You can enter a special meditation that surrounds you with an
                                            aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you gain the effect of a sanctuary
                                            spell that lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end
                                            early as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your Wisdom
                                            modifier + your proficiency bonus.

                                        </p>

                                        <p>17th level: You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone’s
                                            body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 3 ki
                                            points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of
                                            days equal to your monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you use
                                            your action to end them. To do so, you and the target must be on the same
                                            plane of existence. When you use this action, the creature must make a
                                            Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it
                                            succeeds, it takes 10d10 necrotic damage.

                                            You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time.
                                            You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using an action.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Way of Shadow</h4>
                                        <p>Monks of the Way of Shadow follow a tradition that values stealth and
                                            subterfuge. These monks might

                                            be called ninjas or shadowdancers, and they serve as spies and assassins.
                                            Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a
                                            clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are
                                            more like thieves’ guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich
                                            merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees. Regardless of their
                                            methods, the heads of these monasteries expect the unquestioning obedience
                                            of their students.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Shadow Arts</h5>
                                        <p>3rd level: You can use your ki to duplicate the effects of certain spells. As
                                            an action, you can spend 2 ki points to cast darkness, darkvision, pass
                                            without trace, or silence, without providing material components.
                                            Additionally, you gain the minor illusion cantrip if you don’t already know
                                            it.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Shadow Step</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You gain the ability to step from one shadow into another. When
                                            you are in dim light or darkness,

                                            as a bonus action you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you
                                            can see that is also in dim light or darkness. You then have advantage on
                                            the first melee attack you make before the end of the turn.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Cloak of Shadows</h5>
                                        <p>11th level: You have learned to become one with the shadows. When you are in
                                            an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become
                                            invisible. You remain invisible until you make an attack, cast a spell, or
                                            are in an area of bright light.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Opportunist</h5>
                                        <p>17th level: You can exploit a creature's momentary distraction when it is hit
                                            by an attack. Whenever a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack
                                            made by a creature other than you, you can use your reaction to make a melee
                                            attack against that creature.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Way of the Four Elements</h4>
                                        <p>You follow a monastic tradition that teaches you to harness the elements.
                                            When you focus your ki, you can align yourself with the forces of creation
                                            and bend the four elements to your will, using them as an extension of your
                                            body. Some members of this tradition dedicate themselves to a single
                                            element, but others weave the elements together.

                                            Many monks of this tradition tattoo their bodies with representations of
                                            their ki powers, commonly imagined as coiling dragons, but also as
                                            phoenixes, fish, plants, mountains, and cresting waves.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Disciple of the Elements</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            3rd level: You learn magical disciplines that harness the power of the four
                                            elements. A discipline requires you to spend ki points each time you use it.

                                            You know the Elemental Attunement discipline and one other elemental
                                            discipline of your choice, which are detailed in the “Elemental Disciplines”
                                            section below. You learn one additional elemental discipline of your choice
                                            at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.

                                            Whenever you learn a new elemental discipline, you can also replace one
                                            elemental discipline that you already know with a different discipline.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The elemental disciplines are presented in alphabetical order. If a
                                            discipline requires a level, you must be that level in this class to learn
                                            the discipline.</p>

                                                    with amazement.

                                                    A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him
                                                    nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band
                                                    celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst
                                                    and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize
                                                    he is there.

                                                    Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate
                                                    only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his
                                                    eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last
                                                    his light overcomes its hideous darkness.

                                                <br><br>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by
                                                their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a
                                                god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature
                                                spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the
                                                dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a
                                                source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.

                                            <h4>The Cause of Righteousness</h4>
                                            <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the
                                                good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt
                                                the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on
                                                various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the
                                                oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many
                                                paladins are devoted to gods of good, a paladin’s power comes as much
                                                from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a
                                                variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are
                                                secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and
                                                injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent
                                                and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>
                                            <h4>Beyond the Mundane Life</h4>
                                            <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life.
                                                Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a
                                                time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle
                                                against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias
                                                and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true
                                                calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn
                                                from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes
                                                their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite
                                                groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of
                                                righteousness, not to crown and country.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient
                                                ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the
                                                acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests,
                                                and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance
                                                away from oblivion.</p>

                                        <p>
                                            The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor,
                                            and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears. As an action, you
                                            can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until the end of your next
                                            turn, you know the location of any celestial, fiend, or undead within 60
                                            feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial,
                                            fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its
                                            identity. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place
                                            or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the hallow spell.

                                            You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Charisma
                                            modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all expended uses.

                                        <h4>Lay on Hands</h4>
                                        <p>Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that
                                            replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can restore a
                                            total number of hit points equal to your paladin level x 5.

                                            As an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to
                                            restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount
                                            remaining in your pool.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure
                                            the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can
                                            cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of
                                            Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

                                            This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

                                        <p>2nd level: You have learned to draw on divine magic through meditation and
                                            prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.

                                        <p>2nd level: When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend
                                            one paladin spell slot to deal radiant damage to the target, in addition to
                                            the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot,
                                            plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The
                                            damage increases by 1d8 if the target is an undead or a fiend.

                                            time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet
                                            sworn to it. Now you choose the Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients,

                                        <p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th
                                            level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature

                                        <p>Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical effects. Each
                                            Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains how to use it.

                                            can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
                                            ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                            score above 20 using this feature.

                                        <p>5th level: You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the
                                            Attack action on your turn.

                                        <h4>Aura of Protection</h4>
                                        <p>6th level: Whenever you or a friendly creature within 10 feet of you must
                                            make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to the saving throw equal to
                                            your Charisma modifier (with a minimum bonus of +1). You must be conscious
                                            to grant this bonus.

                                            At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.

                                        <p>10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be
                                            frightened while you are conscious. At 18th level, the range of this aura
                                            increases to 30 feet.

                                        <p>11th level: You are so suffused with righteous

                                            might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them.
                                            Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra
                                            1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you
                                            add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.

                                        <h3>Sacred Oaths</h3>
                                        <p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause
                                            of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath,
                                            taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the
                                            paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider
                                            themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this
                                            oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an
                                            official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin’s heart.</p>
                                        <h4>Oath of Devotion</h4>
                                        <p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice,
                                            virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy
                                            warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor,
                                            acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold
                                            themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or
                                            worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this
                                            oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the
                                            measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as
                                            their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or
                                            coats of arms.

                                        <h5>Tenets of Devotion</h5>
                                        <p>Though the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins
                                            of this oath share these tenets.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Honesty </strong>. Don't lie or cheat. Let your word be your

                                            <li><strong>Compassion</strong>. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish
                                                those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with
                                                wisdom.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Honor</strong>. Treat others with fairness, and let your
                                                honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while
                                                causing the least amount of harm.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Duty</strong>. Be responsible for your actions and their
                                                consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who
                                                have just authority over you.

                                        <p>3rd level: You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Sacred Weapon.</strong> As an action, you can imbue one weapon
                                                that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity.
                                                For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with
                                                that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright
                                                light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the
                                                weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Turn the Unholy.</strong>. As an action, you present your holy
                                                symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your
                                                Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within
                                                30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
                                                its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

                                        <h4>Oath of the Ancients</h4>
                                        <p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of
                                            the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights,
                                            paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light

                                            in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and
                                            life-giving things of the world,

                                            not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and
                                            justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing
                                            things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—to reflect their commitment to preserving
                                            life and light in the world.

                                        <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted
                                            centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of
                                            law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.

                                                and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would
                                                swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would
                                                render it barren.
                                            </li>

                                        <p>3rd level: You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Nature’s Wrath.</strong> Invoke primeval forces to ensnare a
                                                foe. As an action, you can cause spectral vines to spring up and reach
                                                for a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see. The creature must
                                                succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) or be
                                                restrained. While restrained by the vines, the creature repeats the
                                                saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a success, it frees
                                                itself and the vines vanish.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Turn the Faithless.</strong>. Utter ancient words that are
                                                painful for fey and fiends to hear. As an action, you present your holy

                                                symbol, and each fey or fiend within 30 feet of you that can hear you
                                                must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
                                                turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.

                                        <p>7th level: Ancient magic lies so heavily upon you that it forms an eldritch
                                            ward. You and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you have resistance to
                                            damage from spells.
                                            At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Undying Sentinel</h5>
                                        <p>15th level: When you are reduced to O hit

                                            points and are not killed outright, you can choose to

                                            drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this ability, you

                                            can't use it again until you finish a long rest. Additionally, you suffer
                                            none of the drawbacks of old

                                            age, and you can’t be aged magically.

                                        <h5>Elder Champion</h5>
                                        <p>20th level: You can assume the form of an ancient

                                            force of nature, taking on an appearance you choose.

                                            For example, your skin might turn green or take ona

                                            bark-like texture, your hair might become leafy or moss-

                                            like, or you might sprout antlers or a lion-like mane. Using your action,
                                            you undergo a transformation.

                                            For 1 minute, you gain the following benefits:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 hit points.</li>
                                            <li>Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action,
                                                you can cast it using a bonus action instead.</li>
                                            <li>
                                                Enemy creatures within 10 feet of you have disadvantage on saving throws
                                                against your paladin spells and Channel Divinity options.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <h4>Oath of Vengeance</h4>
                                        <p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have
                                            committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers,
                                            when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves’
                                            guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the
                                            countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of
                                            Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins—
                                            sometimes called avengers or dark knights—their own purity is not as
                                            important as delivering justice.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Tenets of Vengeance</h5>
                                        <p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets
                                            revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who
                                            uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to
                                            mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral
                                            or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are
                                            brutally simple.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Fight the Greater Evil</strong>. Faced with a choice of fighting
                                                my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.

                                            <li><strong>No Mercy for the Wicked</strong>. Ordinary foes might win my
                                                mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.

                                            <li><strong>By Any Means Necessary</strong>. My qualms can't get in the way

                                                because I failed to stop them. I must heip those harmed by their
                                                misdeeds.

                                        <p>3rd level: You gain the following two Channel Divinity options.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Abjure Enemy.</strong> As an action, you present your holy
                                                symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity.
                                                Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That
                                                creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being
                                                frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Vow of Enmity.</strong>. As a bonus action, you can utter a vow
                                                of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using
                                                your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the
                                                creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls

                                        <h5>Relentless Avenger</h5>
                                        <p>7th level: Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When
                                            you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your
                                            speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This
                                            movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>15th level: The authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you
                                            greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of
                                            Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon
                                            attack against that creature if it is within range.
                                        </p>

                                            <li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.

                                            <li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any
                                                enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle,
                                                the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened
                                                of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against
                                                the frightened creature have advantage.

                                                <em>Rough and wild looking,

                                                    a human stalks alone through the shadows of trees, hunting the orcs
                                                    he knows are planning a raid on a nearby farm. Clutching a
                                                    shortsword in each hand, he becomes a whirlwind of steel, cutting
                                                    down one enemy

                                                    after another.

                                                    After tumbling away from a cone of freezing air, an elf finds her
                                                    feet and draws back her bow to loose an arrow at the white dragon.
                                                    Shrugging off the wave of fear that emanates from the dragon like
                                                    the cold of its breath, she sends one arrow after another to find
                                                    the gaps between the à dragon’s thick scales.

                                                    Holding his hand high, a half-elf whistles to the hawk that circles
                                                    high above him, calling the bird back to his side. Whispering
                                                    instructions in Elvish, he points to the owlbear he’s been tracking
                                                    and sends the hawk to distract the creature while he readies his
                                                    bow.

                                                <br><br>Far from the bustle of cities and towns, past the

                                                hedges that shelter the most distant farms from the terrors of the wild,
                                                amid the dense-packed trees of F trackless forests and across wide and

                                                rangers keep their unending watch.

                                            <h4>Deadly Hunters</h4>
                                            <p>Warriors of the wilderness, rangers specialize in hunting the monsters
                                                that threaten the edges of civilization—humanoid raiders, rampaging
                                                beasts and monstrosities, terrible giants, and deadly dragons. They
                                                learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily
                                                through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble. Rangers
                                                focus their combat training on techniques that are particularly useful
                                                against their specific favored foes.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>Thanks to their familiarity with the wilds, rangers acquire the ability
                                                to cast spells that harness nature’s power, much as a druid does. Their
                                                spells, like their combat abilities, emphasize speed, stealth, and the
                                                hunt. A ranger’s talents and abilities are honed with deadly focus on
                                                the grim task of protecting the borderlands.</p>
                                            <h4>Independent Adventurers</h4>
                                            <p>Though a ranger might make a living as a hunter, a guide, or a tracker, a
                                                ranger’s true calling is to defend the outskirts of civilization from
                                                the ravages of monsters and humanoid hordes that press in from the wild.
                                                In some places, rangers gather in secretive orders or join forces with
                                                druidic circles. Many rangers, though, are independent almost to a
                                                fault, knowing that, when a dragon or a band of orcs attacks, a ranger
                                                might be the first—and possibly the last—line of defense.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>This fierce independence makes rangers well suited to adventuring, since
                                                they are accustomed to life far from the comforts of a dry bed and a hot
                                                bath. Faced with city-bred adventurers who grouse and whine about the
                                                hardships of the wild, rangers respond with some mixture of amusement,
                                                frustration, and compassion. But they quickly learn that other
                                                adventurers who can carry their own weight in a fight against
                                                civilization’s foes are worth any extra burden. Coddled city folk might
                                                not know how to feed themselves or find fresh water in the wild, but
                                                they make up for it in other ways.

                                            Choose a type of favored enemy: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs,
                                            dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or

                                            When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that
                                            is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.

                                            You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language,
                                            at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the

                                            movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed
                                            by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or
                                            a similar hazard.
                                        </p>

                                            materials with which to create your camouflage.
                                            Once you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing
                                            yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at
                                            least as tall and wide as you are.

                                        </p>

                                        <p>18th level: You gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you
                                            can’t see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see
                                            it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.

                                        <p>
                                            You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet
                                            of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren't
                                            blinded or deafened.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>20th level: You become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies. Once on each
                                            of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the
                                            damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You
                                            can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any
                                            effects of the roll are applied.

                                            Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you

                                                to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you

                                                area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt

                                        <p>The Beast Master archetype embodies a friendship between the civilized races
                                            and the beasts of the world. United in focus, beast and ranger work as one
                                            to fight the monstrous foes that threaten civilization and the wilderness
                                            alike. Emulating the Beast Master archetype means committing yourself to
                                            this ideal, working in partnership with an animal as its companion and
                                            friend.

                                        <h5>Ranger's Companion</h5>
                                        <p>3rd level: You gain a beast companion that accompanies you on your adventures
                                            and is trained to fight alongside you. Choose a beast that is no larger than
                                            Medium and that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower (appendix D presents
                                            statistics for the hawk, mastiff, and panther as examples). Add your
                                            proficiency bonus to the beast’s AC, attack rolls, and damage rolls, as well
                                            as to any saving throws and skills it is proficient in. Its hit point
                                            maximum equals its normal maximum or four times your ranger level, whichever
                                            is higher.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your
                                            initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On
                                            your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move (no action
                                            required by you). You can use your action to verbally command it to take the
                                            Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra
                                            Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the
                                            beast to take the Attack action.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can
                                            move stealthily at a normal pace.

                                            If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically
                                            bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type
                                            of beast as before or a different one.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Exceptional Training</h5>
                                        <p>7th level: On any of your turns when your beast companion doesn’t attack, you
                                            can use a bonus action to command the beast to take the Dash, Disengage,
                                            Dodge, or Help action on its turn.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Bestial Fury</h5>
                                        <p>11th level: Your beast companion can make two attacks when you command it to
                                            use the Attack action.</p>
                                        <h5>Share Spells</h5>
                                        <p>15th level: When you cast a spell targeting yourself, you can also affect
                                            your beast companion with the spell if the beast is within 30 feet of you.

                                                a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities,
                                                giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many
                                                rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills
                                                that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and
                                                disarming traps, and opening locks.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A
                                                rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the
                                                attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a
                                                barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for
                                                avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their
                                                other abilities.

                                            </p>
                                            <h4>A Shady Living</h4>
                                            <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the
                                                worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins,
                                                cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into
                                                thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate
                                                independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them
                                                in their scams

                                                and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths,
                                                investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world
                                                where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened
                                                criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while
                                                others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have
                                                learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of
                                                infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.

                                        <p>1st level: Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of your skill
                                            proficiencies and your proficiency with thieves’ tools. Your proficiency
                                            bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the
                                            chosen proficiencies.

                                            At 6th level, you can choose two more of your proficiencies (in skills or
                                            with thieves’ tools) to gain this benefit.

                                        <h4>Sneak Attack</h4>
                                        <p>1st level: You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe’s distraction.
                                            Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with
                                            an attack if you have advantage on the attack roll. The attack must use a
                                            finesse or a ranged weapon.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>You don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is
                                            within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and you don't have
                                            disadvantage on the attack roll.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Thieves' Cant</h4>
                                        <p>During your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix of
                                            dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in seemingly
                                            normal conversation. Only another creature that knows thieves’ cant
                                            understands such messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a
                                            message than it does to speak the same idea plainly.</p>
                                        <p>In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey
                                            short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the
                                            territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people
                                            in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the
                                            run. </p>
                                        <h4>Cunning Action</h4>
                                        <p>2nd level: Your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly.
                                            You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can
                                            be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Roguish Archetype</h4>
                                        <p>3rd level: You choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your
                                            rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the
                                            end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at
                                            3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
                                        <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
                                            can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
                                            ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                            score above 20 using this feature.

                                        <p>5th level: When an attacker that you can see

                                            hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s
                                            damage against you.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Evasion</h4>
                                        <p>7th level: You can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such
                                            as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell. When you are subjected
                                            to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only
                                            half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw,
                                            and only half damage if you fail.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Reliable Talent</h4>
                                        <p>11th level: You have refined your chosen skills until they approach
                                            perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your
                                            proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Blindsense</h4>
                                        <p>14th level: If you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any
                                            hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Slippery Mind</h4>
                                        <p>15th level: You have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency
                                            in Wisdom saving throws.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Elusive</h4>
                                        <p>18th level: You are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand
                                            against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren't
                                            incapacitated.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Stroke of Luck</h4>
                                        <p>20th level: You have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If
                                            your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit.
                                            Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a
                                            20.

                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.

                                        <h3>Roguish Archetypes</h3>
                                        <p>Rogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting
                                            their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their
                                            increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in
                                            varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of
                                            archetype is a reflection of your focus— not necessarily an indication of
                                            your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Thief</h4>
                                        <p>You hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and
                                            other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer
                                            to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers,
                                            and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you
                                            learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar
                                            languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Fast Hands</h5>
                                        <p>3rd level: You can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to
                                            make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm
                                            a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Second-Story Work</h5>
                                        <p>3rd level: You gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no
                                            longer costs you extra movement.

                                            turn in the combat yet. In addition, any hit you score against a creature
                                            that is surprised is a critical hit.

                                        <p>9th level: You can unfailingly create false identities for yourself. You must
                                            spend seven days and 25 gp to establish the history, profession, and
                                            affiliations for an identity. You can’t establish an identity that belongs
                                            to someone else. For example, you might acquire appropriate clothing,
                                            letters of introduction, and officiallooking certification to establish
                                            yourself as a member of a trading house from a remote city so you can
                                            insinuate yourself into the company of other wealthy merchants. Thereafter,
                                            if you adopt the new identity as a disguise, other creatures believe you to
                                            be that person until given an obvious reason not to.

                                        <p>13th level: You gain the ability to unerringly mimic another person’s speech,
                                            writing, and behavior.

                                            You must spend at least three hours studying

                                            these three components of the person's behavior, listening to speech,
                                            examining handwriting, and observing mannerisms.

                                            Your ruse is indiscernible to the casual observer. If a wary creature
                                            suspects something is amiss, you have advantage on any Charisma (Deception)

                                                <br><br>Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an
                                                exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown
                                                cosmic forces. One can’t study sorcery as one learns a language, any
                                                more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses
                                                sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.

                                            <h4>Raw Magic</h4>
                                            <p>Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with
                                                a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that
                                                springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons.
                                                Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that
                                                manifests in unexpected ways.
                                            </p>

                                            <p>The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic
                                                bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in
                                                other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time,
                                                the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't
                                                name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events
                                                in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a
                                                baby’s birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might
                                                spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic,
                                                exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening
                                                chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore
                                                that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells
                                                as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn
                                                magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.

                                            <h4>Unexplained Powers</h4>
                                            <p>Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it’s unusual to find a sorcerer who
                                                is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical
                                                power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn’t like
                                                to stay quiet. A sorcerer’s magic wants to be wielded, and it has a
                                                tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn’t called on.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to
                                                adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that
                                                infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to
                                                find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever
                                                their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party
                                                as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical
                                                knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.</p>

                                        <h4>Sorcerous Origins</h4>
                                        <p>Different sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic. Although
                                            many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two categories: a
                                            draconic bloodline and wild magic.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Draconic BLoodline</h4>
                                        <p>Your innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood
                                            or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace
                                            their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain
                                            with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these
                                            bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any
                                            given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact
                                            or some other exceptional circumstances.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Draconic Ancestor</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: You choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type
                                            associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later. You can
                                            speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma
                                            check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it
                                            applies to the check.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Draconic Resilience</h5>
                                        <p>As magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon
                                            ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and
                                            increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class. Additionally,
                                            parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When
                                            you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Elemental Affinity</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: When you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated
                                            with your draconic ancestry, add your Charisma modifier to that damage. At
                                            the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that
                                            damage type for 1 hour.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Dragon Wings</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: You gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your
                                            back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed. You can create
                                            these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them
                                            as a bonus action on your turn.

                                            You can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made
                                            to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might
                                            be destroyed when you manifest them.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Draconic Presence</h5>
                                        <p>18th level: You can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor,
                                            causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action,
                                            you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of
                                            awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until
                                            you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell),
                                            each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a
                                            Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you
                                            chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving
                                            throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Nature's Sanctuary</h5>
                                        <p>10th level: You can’t be charmed or frightened by elementals or fey, and you
                                            are immune to poison and disease.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Wild Magic</h4>
                                        <p>Your innate magic comes from the wild forces of chaos that underlie the order
                                            of creation. You might have endured exposure to some form of raw magic,
                                            perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Planes, or
                                            the mysterious Far Realm. Perhaps you

                                            were blessed by a powerful fey creature or marked by a demon. Or your magic
                                            could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause or reason. However it
                                            came to be, this chaotic magic churns within you, waiting for any outlet.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Wild Magic Surge</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Immediately
                                            after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher, the DM can have you
                                            roll a d20. If you roll a

                                            1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a random magical effect.</p>
                                        <h5>Tides of Chaos</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: You can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain
                                            advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do
                                            so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again. Any
                                            time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on
                                            the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of
                                            1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

                                        <h5>Bend Luck</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When
                                            another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a
                                            saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll
                                            1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the
                                            creature’s roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any
                                            effects of the roll occur.</p>
                                        <h5>Controlled Chaos</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: You gain a modicum of control over the surges of your wild magic.
                                            Whenever you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table, you can roll twice and use
                                            either number.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>18th level: The harmful energy of your spells intensifies. When you roll
                                            damage for a spell and roll the highest number possible on any of the dice,
                                            choose one of those dice, roll it again and add that roll to the damage. You
                                            can use the feature only once per turn.

                                                fabric of the multiverse. Through pacts made with mysterious beings of
                                                supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and

                                                warlocks piece together arcane secrets to bolster their own power.

                                            <h4>Sworn and Beholden</h4>
                                            <p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being. Sometimes the
                                                relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a
                                                deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not
                                                gods. A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an
                                                archdevil, or an utterly alien entity—beings not typically served by
                                                clerics. More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between
                                                a master and an apprentice. The warlock learns and grows in power, at
                                                the cost of occasional services performed on the patron’s behalf.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>The magic bestowed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations
                                                to the warlock’s being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to
                                                read any language) to access to powerful spells. Unlike bookish wizards,
                                                warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand
                                                combat. They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple
                                                weapons.

                                            </p>
                                            <h4>Delvers into Secrets</h4>
                                            <p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which
                                                compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives. This thirst drives
                                                warlocks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.

                                                Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known. But
                                                many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish. Sometimes a traveler
                                                in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or
                                                lady, and stumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it. And
                                                sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a brilliant but
                                                crazed student’s mind is opened to realities beyond the material world
                                                and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>Once a pact is made, a warlock’s thirst for knowledge and power can't be
                                                slaked with mere study and research. No one makes a pact with such a
                                                mighty patron if he or she doesn’t intend to use the power thus gained.
                                                Rather, the vast majority of warlocks spend their days in active pursuit
                                                of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring.
                                                Furthermore, the demands of their patrons drive warlocks toward
                                                adventure.

                                            options are detailed at the end of the class description. When you gain
                                            certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as
                                            shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.

                                            Additionally, when you gain a tevel in this class, you can choose one of the
                                            invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could

                                        <h4>Pact Boon</h4>
                                        <p>3rd level: Your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal
                                            service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Pact of the Chain</h5>
                                        <p>You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell
                                            doesn’t count against your number of spells known.

                                            When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your
                                            familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit,
                                            or sprite.

                                            Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own
                                            attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own.</p>
                                        <h5>Pact of the Blade</h5>
                                        <p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can
                                            choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see
                                            chapter 5 for weapon options). You are proficient with it while you wield
                                            it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose

                                            of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
                                        <h5>Pact of the Tome</h5>
                                        <p>Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this
                                            feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list. While the book
                                            is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don't count
                                            against your number of cantrips known.

                                            If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to
                                            receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed
                                            during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book
                                            turns to ash when you die.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Ability Score Improvement</h4>
                                        <p>When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you
                                            can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two
                                            ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability
                                            score above 20 using this feature.

                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Mystic Arcanum</h4>
                                        <p>11th level: Your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.
                                            Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.

                                            You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You
                                            must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
                                        <p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be
                                            cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at
                                            15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of
                                            your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>Eldritch Master</h4>
                                        <p>20th level: You can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while
                                            entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1
                                            minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell
                                            slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this
                                            feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

                                        <h3>Otherworldly Patrons</h3>
                                        <p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other
                                            planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various
                                            patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and
                                            expect significant favors in return. Some patrons collect warlocks, doling
                                            out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind
                                            mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and
                                            might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron
                                            might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.

                                        </p>

                                        <p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature of legend who holds
                                            secrets that were forgotten before

                                            the mortal races were born. This being’s motivations are often inscrutable,
                                            and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical
                                            power or the settling of age-old grudges. Beings of this sort include the
                                            Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court;
                                            Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Green Lord; Hyrsam, the
                                            Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.

                                        <h5>Fey Presence</h5>
                                        <p>1st level: Your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling
                                            and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature
                                            in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against
                                            your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are
                                            all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next
                                            turn.
                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Misty Escapes</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you
                                            take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to
                                            60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the
                                            start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.

                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.</p>
                                        <h5>Beguiling Defenses</h5>
                                        <p>10th level: Your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of
                                            your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another
                                            creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn
                                            the charm back on

                                            that creature.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Dark Delirium</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: You can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action,
                                            choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a
                                            Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it
                                            is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your
                                            concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell), This
                                            effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. Until this illusion
                                            ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of
                                            which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the
                                            illusion. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this
                                            feature again.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>The Fiend</h4>
                                        <p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being
                                            whose aims are evil,

                                            even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or
                                            destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough
                                            to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu,
                                            and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and
                                            Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and
                                            other lords of the yugoloths.
                                        </p>

                                            temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level
                                            (minimum of 1).
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Dark One's Own Luck</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you
                                            make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a
                                            d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any
                                            of the roll’s effects occur.

                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.</p>

                                        <p>10th level: You can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long
                                            rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different
                                            one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores
                                            this resistance.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Hurl Through Hell</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: When you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature
                                            to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature
                                            disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your
                                            next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the
                                            nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10
                                            psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this
                                            feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

                                        <h4>The Great Old One</h4>
                                        <p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the
                                            fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond
                                            reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its
                                            motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and
                                            ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast
                                            secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence

                                        <p>1st level: Your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of
                                            other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you
                                            can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the
                                            creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature
                                            must be able to understand at least one language.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Entropic Ward</h5>
                                        <p>6th level: You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an
                                            enemy’s failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an
                                            attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on
                                            that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the
                                            creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn.

                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.</p>
                                        <h5>Thought Shield</h5>
                                        <p>10th level: Your thoughts can’t be read by telepathy or other means unless
                                            you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a
                                            creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of
                                            damage that you do.

                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Create Thrall</h5>
                                        <p>14th level: You gain the ability to infect a humanoid’s mind with the alien
                                            magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated
                                            humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a remove curse spell is
                                            cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this
                                            feature again.

                                            You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the
                                            two of you are on the same plane of existence.

                                            You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its

                                                    spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where
                                                    it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers.

                                                    Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic
                                                    circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered
                                                    iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is
                                                    complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside
                                                    the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly
                                                    plane beyond.

                                                    Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a
                                                    handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a
                                                    few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions
                                                    more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down
                                                    the passage to his left.

                                                <br><br>Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class
                                                by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that
                                                permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing
                                                lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic

                                            <p>Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws
                                                students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like
                                                the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell
                                                requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures,
                                                and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface
                                                components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of
                                                apprenticeship and countless hours of study.

                                            </p>

                                            <p>Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They
                                                learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can
                                                also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions,
                                                and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.

                                            <h4>The Lure of Knowledge</h4>
                                            <p>Wizards’ lives are seldom mundane. The closest a wizard is likely to come
                                                to an ordinary life is working as a sage or lecturer in a library or
                                                university, teaching others the secrets of the multiverse. Other wizards
                                                sell their services as diviners, serve in military forces, or pursue
                                                lives of crime or domination.

                                            </p>
                                            <p>But the lure of knowledge and power calls even the most unadventurous
                                                wizards out of the safety of their libraries and laboratories and into
                                                crumbling ruins and lost cities. Most wizards believe that their
                                                counterparts in ancient civilizations knew secrets of magic that have
                                                been lost to the ages, and discovering those secrets could unlock the
                                                path to a power greater than any magic available in the present age.

                                        <p>2nd level: You choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic
                                            through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination,

                                            Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and

                                        <h4>Spell Mastery</h4>
                                        <p>18th level: You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can
                                            cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard
                                            spell that are in your spelibook. You can cast those spells at their lowest
                                            level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you

                                            By spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you

                                            little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your
                                            signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count
                                            against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of
                                            them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you
                                            can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest. If you want to cast
                                            either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.

                                        <p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal
                                            discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in the worlds of D&D, with
                                            various traditions dedicated to its complex study.

                                            The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the
                                            schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of
                                            spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places,
                                            these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School
                                            of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment.
                                            In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with
                                            rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train
                                            apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic
                                            into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require
                                            mastery of different techniques.
                                        </p>
                                        <h4>School of Abjuration</h4>
                                        <p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects.
                                            Detractors of this school say

                                            that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion.
                                            You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak,
                                            and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. Itis a
                                            proud and respected vocation.

                                            Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits
                                            require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical
                                            spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.

                                            your spellbook is halved.</p>
                                        <h5>Arcane Ward</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: You can weave magic around yourself for protection. When you cast
                                            an abjuration spell of 1st level or higher, you can simultaneously use a
                                            strand of the spell’s magic to create a magical ward on yourself that lasts
                                            until you finish a long rest. The ward has hit points equal to twice your
                                            wizard level + your Intelligence modifier. Whenever you take damage, the
                                            ward takes the damage instead. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit

                                            can’t absorb damage. but its magic remains. Whenever you cast an abjuration
                                            spell of 1st level or higher, the ward regains a | number of hit points
                                            equal to twice the level of the spell. Once you create the ward, you can't
                                            create it again until you finish a long rest.

                                            damage, you can use your reaction to cause your Arcane Ward to absorb that
                                            damage. If this damage reduces the ward to 0 hit points, the warded creature
                                            takes any remaining damage.

                                            the end of your next turn. The charmed creature’s speed drops to 0, and the
                                            creature is incapacitated and visibly dazed.

                                            On subsequent turns, you can use your action to maintain this effect,
                                            extending its duration until the end of your next turn. However, the effect

                                            Once the effect ends, or if the creature succeeds on its initial saving

                                            to it, not including you or itself. If multiple creatures are closest, the
                                            attacker chooses which one to target. On a successful save, you can’t use
                                            this feature on the attacker again until you finish a long rest.

                                            You must choose to use this feature before knowing whether the attack hits
                                            or misses. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.

                                        <p>10th level: When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher that
                                            targets only one creature, you can have it target a second creature.

                                        <h5>Alter Memories</h5>
                                        <p> 14th level: You gain the ability to make a creature unaware of your magical
                                            influence on it. When you cast an enchantment spell to charm one or more
                                            creatures, you can alter one creature's understanding so that it remains
                                            unaware of being charmed.

                                            Additionally, once before the spell expires, you can use your action to try
                                            to make the chosen creature forget some of the time it spent charmed. The
                                            creature must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw against your wizard
                                            spell save DC or lose a number of hours of its memories equal to 1 + your
                                            Charisma modifier (minimum 1). You can make the creature forget less time,
                                            and the amount of time can’t exceed the duration of your enchantment spell.

                                        <p>You focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as
                                            bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and
                                            burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as
                                            artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular
                                            power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits,
                                            adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.

                                        <p>2nd level: The gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into
                                            your spellbook is halved.</p>
                                        <h5>Sculpt Spells</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: You can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of
                                            your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other
                                            creatures that you can see, you can choose a number

                                            of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically
                                            succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if
                                            they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

                                        <p>6th Level: Your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt
                                            of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your
                                            cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers
                                            no additional effect from the cantrip.

                                        <p>10th level: You can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage roll of any
                                            wizard evocation spell you cast.</p>
                                        <h5>Overchannel</h5>
                                        <p> 14th level: You can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast
                                            a wizard spell of 5th level or lower that deals damage, you can deal maximum
                                            damage with that spell.

                                            The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this
                                            feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage
                                            for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you
                                            use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per
                                            spell level increases by 1d12.

                                        <h4>School of Illusion</h4>
                                        <p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind,
                                            and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions
                                            crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some
                                            illusionists—including many gnome wizards—are benign tricksters who use
                                            their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception,
                                            using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.

                                            your spellbook is halved.</p>
                                        <h5>Improved Minor Illusion</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level:
                                            You learn the minor illusion cantrip. If you already know this cantrip, you
                                            learn a different wizard cantrip of your choice. The cantrip doesn’t count
                                            against your number of cantrips known. l

                                            When you cast minor illusion, you can create both a l sound and an image
                                            with a single casting of the spell.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Malleable Illusions</h5>
                                        <p>6th Level: When you cast an illusion spell that has a duration of 1 minute or
                                            longer, you can use your action to change the nature of that illusion (using
                                            the spell’s normal parameters for the illusion), provided that f you can see
                                            the illusion.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Illusory Self</h5>
                                        <p>10th level:
                                            You can create an illusory duplicate of yourself as an instant, almost
                                            instinctual reaction to danger. When a creature makes an attack f roll
                                            against you, you can use your reaction to interpose the illusory duplicate
                                            between the attacker and l yourself. The attack automatically misses you,
                                            then the illusion dissipates. l

                                            Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short
                                            or long rest.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Illusory Reality</h5>
                                        <p> 14th level: You have learned the secret of weaving shadow magic into your
                                            illusions to give them a semireality. When you cast an illusion spell of 1st
                                            level or higher, you can choose one inanimate, nonmagical object that is
                                            part of the illusion and make that object real. You can do this on your turn
                                            as a bonus action while the spell is ongoing. The object remains real for 1
                                            minute. For example, you can create an illusion of a bridge over a chasm and
                                            then make it real long enough for your allies to cross.

                                            The object can’t deal damage or otherwise directly harm anyone.</p>
                                        <h4>School of Necromancy</h4>
                                        <p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and
                                            undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to
                                            manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you
                                            learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body,
                                            transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.

                                            Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the
                                            close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces
                                            they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.

                                        <p>2nd level: You gain the ability to reap life energy from creatures you kill
                                            with your spells. Once per turn when you kill one or more creatures with a
                                            spell of Ist level or higher, you regain hit points equal to twice the
                                            spell’s level, or three times its level if the spell belongs to the School
                                            of Necromancy. You don’t gain this benefit for killing constructs or undead.

                                        <p>6th Level: You add the animate dead spell to your spellbook if it is not
                                            there already. When you cast animate dead, you can target one additional
                                            corpse or pile of bones, creating another zombie or skeleton, as
                                            appropriate.

                                            and the forces that animate them that you have become inured to some of
                                            their worst effects.

                                        <p> 14th level: You can use magic to bring undead under your control, even those
                                            created by other wizards. As an action, you can choose one undead that you
                                            can see within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a Charisma saving
                                            throw against your wizard spell save DC. If it succeeds, you can’t use this
                                            feature on it again. If it fails, it becomes friendly to you and obeys your
                                            commands until you use this feature again. Intelligent undead are harder to
                                            control in this way. If the target has an Intelligence of 8 or higher, it
                                            has advantage on the saving throw. If it fails the saving throw and has an
                                            Intelligence of 12 or higher, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of
                                            every hour until it succeeds and breaks free.

                                            To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you
                                            delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and
                                            learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives
                                            you the tools to become a smith on reality’s forge.

                                            Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and
                                            transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue
                                            their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods
                                            to make and destroy worlds.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Evocation Savant</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: The gold and time you must spend to copy an transmutation spell
                                            into
                                            your spellbook is halved.</p>
                                        <h5>Minor Alchemy</h5>
                                        <p>2nd level: you can temporarily alter the physical properties of one
                                            nonmagical object, changing it from one substance into another. You perform
                                            a special alchemical procedure on one object composed entirely of wood,
                                            stone (but not a gemstone), iron, copper, or silver, transforming it into a
                                            different one of those materials. For each 10 minutes
                                            you spend performing the procedure, you can transform up to 1 cubic foot of
                                            material. After 1 hour, or until you lose your concentration (as if you were
                                            concentrating on a spell), the material reverts to its original substance.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Transmuter's Stone</h5>
                                        <p>6th Level: You can spend 8 hours creating a transmuter'’s stone that stores
                                            transmutation magic. You can benefit from the stone yourself or give it to
                                            another creature. A creature gains a benefit of your choice

                                            as long as the stone is in the creature’s possession. When you create the
                                            stone, choose the benefit from the following options:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.</li>
                                            <li>An increase to speed of 10 feet while the creature is unencumbered.</li>
                                            <li>Proficiency in Constitution saving throws.</li>
                                            <li>Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your
                                                choice whenever you choose this benefit).</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        Each time you cast a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, you can change
                                        the effect of your stone if the stone is on your person.

                                        If you create a new transmuter’s stone, the previous one ceases to function.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Shapechanger</h5>
                                        <p>10th level: You add the <em>polymorph</em> spell to your spellbook, if it is
                                            not there already. You can cast polymorph without expending a spell slot.
                                            When you do so, you can target only yourself and transform into a beast
                                            whose challenge rating is 1 or lower.

                                            Once you cast <em>polymorph</em> in this way, you can’t do so again until
                                            you finish a short or long rest, though you can still cast it normally using
                                            an available spell slot.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>Master Transmuter</h5>
                                        <p> 14th level: you can use your action to consume the reserve of transmutation
                                            magic stored within your transmuter's stone in a single burst. When you do
                                            so, choose one of the following effects. Your transmuter’s stone is
                                            destroyed and can't be remade until you finish a long rest.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Major Transformation </strong>. You can transmute one nonmagical
                                                object—no larger than a 5-foot cube—into another nonmagical object of
                                                similar size and mass and of equal or lesser value. You must spend 10
                                                minutes handling the object to transform it.
                                            </li>

                                            <li><strong>Panacea</strong>. You remove all curses, diseases, and poisons
                                                affecting a creature that you touch with the transmuter’s stone. The
                                                creature also regains all its hit points.
                                            </li>

                                            <li><strong>Restore Life</strong>. You cast the <em>raise dead </em>spell on
                                                a creature you touch with the transmuter’s stone, without expending a
                                                spell slot or needing to have the spell in your spellbook.
                                            </li>
                                            <li><strong>Restore Youth</strong>. You touch the transmuter’s stone to a
                                                willing creature, and that creature’s apparent age is reduced by 3d10
                                                years, to a minimum of 13 years. This effect doesn’t extend the
                                                creature’s lifespan.
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>
                                        </p>
